  Capture a website and create a HyperFrames video from it. Use when: (1) a user provides a URL and wants a video, (2) someone says "capture this site", "turn this into a video", "make a promo from my site", (3) the user wants a social ad, product tour, or any video based on an existing website, (4) the user shares a link and asks for any kind of video content. Even if the user just pastes a URL — this is the skill to use.

# Website to HyperFrames

Capture a website, then produce a professional video from it — collaboratively with the user.

**Take your time on thinking and reviewing.** Quality matters more than speed. Read every reference file the steps point to. Look at every snapshot carefully. If a composition looks weak, revise it before moving on. A polished video is worth more than a rushed one delivered 5 minutes faster. That said: don't sit idle on stuck commands — escalate immediately if a process hangs (see Step 4 for escalation order).

**This is a collaborative workflow by default.** At key moments (marked 💬), you stop and ask the user what they want and refine based on their feedback.

**Autonomous mode exception:** If the user says "decide for me", "just build it", "surprise me", or gives any signal they don't want to be asked questions — skip ALL 💬 gates. Make all creative decisions yourself (video type, style, voice, storyboard), and present the finished result for feedback at the end. Do not ask four separate questions across four separate steps. Read the room once and commit.

**Sub-agent mode (default):** Step 5 dispatches one sub-agent per beat. Each sub-agent reads [beat-builder-guide.md](references/beat-builder-guide.md), builds, lints, snapshots, and verifies its own beat before reporting back. The main agent assembles the final video and does a final check.

**No sub-agents:** If the user says "no sub-agents", "build it yourself", or the runtime doesn't support parallel agents — the main agent builds all compositions sequentially using the same beat-builder-guide workflow. Same quality, just slower.

**This skill requires image-viewing capability** for the validate step (Step 6). If your agent cannot view PNG files, the snapshot review will be blind. Contact sheets (Step 0 and Step 6) are designed to minimize the number of images needed — but some visual verification is unavoidable.

## The Creative Tension Principle

Before writing the first beat of any storyboard, answer this in one sentence:

> **"What makes this video different from a generic [video type] for any [industry] brand?"**

If you can't answer it, you haven't thought enough. A product demo for a fintech tool and a product demo for a design tool should not share the same visual DNA. The answer comes from this specific brand's captured assets, its visual language, and what the user said they want — not from a lookup table.

This principle applies at every creative decision point: picking a visual style, choosing transitions, writing beats, building compositions. Every choice should be traceable to something specific about this brand, not just to "this is what I do for cinematic videos."

Users say things like:

- "Capture https://... and make me a 25-second product launch video"
- "Turn this website into a 15-second social ad for Instagram"
- "Create a 30-second product tour from https://..."

## Step -1: What we're actually making (REQUIRED before Step 0)

You're not making _a video_. You're making something that **stops scrollers** in the first 1.5 seconds and **feels alive in every single frame** — with motion, depth, momentum, like things exist in a physical world. **Think about how to go viral.** Slow intros are for cinematic trailers; videos shipping anywhere social or feed-based need a hook that beats the 1.5-second scroll threshold.

**Get everything you need yourself.** Compose the load-bearing visuals — kanban boards from cards-as-divs, logos from SVG paths, gradients from shader noise, counters via `tl.set()`, dashboards from layered panels, transitions from chromatic-split or ripple shaders. You are not limited to what was captured from the website. You can paint anything a browser can render. Every beat should be composed 100% from divs/SVG/canvas, zero captured screenshots, every frame moving.

**Captured assets are accents and decorations, not the beat itself.** The brand logo on the closer. A hero illustration as a depth layer. A gradient image painted into a parallax background. The brand mark stamped onto a composed product UI. These enhance the beats you compose; they don't replace them. The most suitable combinations weave composed motion together with captured brand inflections — but composed motion is what carries the video.

**The screenshot trap:** if the user's prompt pulls you toward using a product screenshot of an interface (kanban, chat, dashboard, terminal, etc.) as the primary visual of any beat — STOP. Build that UI from divs/SVG/CSS instead. Every prior eval round showed agents defaulting to "screenshot + Ken Burns + voiceover" regardless of what the prompt asked for, never reaching for HTML-in-canvas, SVG path drawing, counter animations, kinetic typography, or any of HyperFrames' powerful capabilities. Don't be that agent.

## Step 0: Capture

**Read:** [references/step-0-capture.md](references/step-0-capture.md)

Run the capture, read ALL extracted data (screenshots, tokens, design styles, text, assets, animations), write a site summary.

**Gate:** Site summary printed. Capture data fully read and summarized.

---

## Step 1: Brand Identity

**Read:** [references/step-1-design.md](references/step-1-design.md)

Write DESIGN.md — a brand cheat sheet covering the visual identity: colors, typography, component styles, layout principles. Use `design-styles.json` for exact computed values.

**Speed option:** For fast-pacing videos (billboard-per-beat), DESIGN.md can be a 50-line summary of colors + fonts + do's/don'ts — not a 300-line document. The sub-agent prompt in Step 5 pastes brand values directly, so DESIGN.md depth only matters for complex compositions.

**Gate:** `DESIGN.md` exists (any length) with at minimum: color palette, font choices, and do's/don'ts.

---

## Step 2: Creative Brief

**Read:** [references/step-2-brief.md](references/step-2-brief.md), [references/visual-vocabulary.md](references/visual-vocabulary.md), [references/capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md) (scan the Table of Contents — deep-dive sections only as needed)

Parse what the user already told you in their prompt. Most prompts already specify video type, style, and what to show. Only ask about things genuinely missing — don't re-ask what they said.

**Gate:** You know the video type, duration, style, and format — either from the user's prompt or by deciding yourself.

---

## Step 3: Storyboard + Script 💬

**Read:** [references/step-3-storyboard.md](references/step-3-storyboard.md)

Write the storyboard (concept-first beats, asset assignments, transitions, depth layers), then the narration script to match — both live in this step because they're coupled. Present both to the user with a beat-by-beat summary. Iterate until they approve.

**Gate:** `STORYBOARD.md` + `SCRIPT.md` exist AND the user has approved the plan.

---

## Step 4: VO, Timing + Captions 💬

**Read:** [references/step-4-vo.md](references/step-4-vo.md)

If the Creative Brief says no narration — ask about background music, then skip to Step 5. Otherwise: ask the user which TTS provider (HeyGen TTS, ElevenLabs, or Kokoro), generate audio, transcribe, map timestamps to beats. Then ask about captions.

**Gate:** Either (a) no narration was requested and storyboard has manual beat timings, or (b) `narration.wav` + `transcript.json` exist and beat timings updated with real durations.

---

## Step 5: Build Compositions

**Read:** The `hyperframes` skill (load it — every rule matters)
**Read:** [references/step-5-build.md](references/step-5-build.md)

Build index.html and compositions following the architecture and pacing chosen in the storyboard (Step 3). See step-5 for code patterns for both architectures (stacked beats vs HyperShader sub-compositions).

**Gate:** Every composition self-reviewed. Frames are full, elements readable, concept clear.

---

## Step 6: Validate & Deliver

**Read:** [references/step-6-validate.md](references/step-6-validate.md)

Lint, validate, take snapshots scaled to video length (formula: `max(beats × 3, ceil(duration_seconds / 2))`), and review each one. Fix issues before delivering. Deliver the localhost Studio project URL — only render to MP4 on explicit user request.

**Deliver something you're proud of.** Before handing off, ask yourself: would I post this on social media with my name on it? If not, fix what's wrong.

**Gate:** `npx hyperframes lint` and `npx hyperframes validate` pass with zero errors, and the final response includes the active Studio project URL.

## Quick Reference

### Video Types

Typical constraints by video type — use as a starting point, not a formula. Beat count should follow from the content and the narration, not from a target range.

| Type                  | Typical duration | Duration driver    | Narration             |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Social ad (IG/TikTok) | 10–15s           | Platform limit     | Optional              |
| Product demo          | 30–60s           | Script length      | Full narration        |
| Feature announcement  | 15–30s           | Feature complexity | Full narration        |
| Brand reel            | 20–45s           | Music track        | Optional, music focus |
| Launch teaser         | 10–20s           | Hook energy        | Minimal               |

Beat count is not in this table intentionally — it should come from the storyboard, not from "social ad = 3-4 beats." A social ad for a complex product might need 5 well-timed beats. A brand reel with one strong visual thesis might need 3.

### Format

- **Landscape**: 1920x1080 (default)
- **Portrait**: 1080x1920 (Instagram Stories, TikTok)
- **Square**: 1080x1080 (Instagram feed)

### User Interaction Points

| Step                         | What to ask                                  | Why                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 2 (Brief)               | Video type, style, specific requests, format | Creative direction sets everything. Wrong direction = wasted build time.        |
| Step 3 (Storyboard + Script) | Beat-by-beat approval, script review         | Cheapest place to iterate. 30s to change a beat, 5min to rebuild a composition. |
| Step 4 (VO)                  | TTS provider choice, API key if needed       | Voice quality makes or breaks the video. User may have provider preferences.    |
