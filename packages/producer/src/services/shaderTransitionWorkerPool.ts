/**
 * Pool of Node `worker_threads` Workers for off-main-thread shader-blend
 * execution. See `shaderTransitionWorker.ts` for the per-worker contract and
 * the hf#677 follow-up rationale (closing the JS event-loop ceiling on the
 * layered transition path).
 *
 * Pool shape:
 *
 * - Spawned once at the start of a layered render and terminated in the
 *   `finally`. Worker spawn cost is ~10–50 ms each; amortized over the
 *   full transition phase (typically 100+ frames) it's negligible.
 * - Pool size is sized to `min(layeredWorkerCount, cpuCount)`. We don't
 *   spawn more workers than DOM sessions (no benefit — at most N DOM
 *   sessions can be dispatching to us at any moment) and we don't oversubscribe
 *   beyond physical cores.
 * - Each Worker holds zero per-frame state. Pool simply dispatches one
 *   shader-blend per Worker at a time; ordering within the pool doesn't
 *   matter because each frame's output is gated by the encoder's
 *   `FrameReorderBuffer` upstream.
 *
 * API:
 *
 *   const pool = await createShaderTransitionWorkerPool({ size, log });
 *   const result = await pool.run({
 *     shader, bufferA, bufferB, output, width, height, progress,
 *   });
 *   // result.bufferA / result.bufferB / result.output are the same memory,
 *   // now re-attached to the main thread.
 *   await pool.terminate();
 *
 * Buffer transfer contract: `run` takes Node Buffers, transfers their
 * underlying ArrayBuffers to the worker, and returns NEW Buffer views over
 * the transferred-back ArrayBuffers. The caller is responsible for
 * swapping its Buffer references — the *original* Buffers passed in are
 * detached (their `.length` becomes 0 / accessing throws) after `run` resolves.
